1. What did you like about this website?
I love the style of your website! The red borders look very nice, and I love the way they complement the dark yellow header. I think
the style of your website is very nice to look at.
2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
One difference I noticed is that my header sticks to the top of my page when I scroll and yours does not (this obviously doesn't matter it's just something I noticed).
    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think both of our websites have good usability. We both have sites that are easy to navigate and easy to read.
    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    Our codebases are equally maintainable. We both have our CSS and images in their respective folders. We also both do a good job of having our shared CSS in the same file which makes our sites easier to maintain.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
Yes, the code is very well structured and like I said above, having shared CSS style in the same file makes the code very organized.
    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements
    N/A
4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
The only issue I found is that the picture of the Whitetail Deer is not contained inside its border and runs off the page. Other than this,
it looks very good!
    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
    Yes, the variable and class names used are easy to understand and the code is formatted very well.
    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Yes, the shared CSS file seems to have everything that is shared contained inside it, so it limits duplication.
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
Again, the site looks great, and I love the red and yellow theme. Maybe just add a little bit more content if you would like. But overall, 
you did a fantastic job!
